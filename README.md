# 🎮 Multiplayer games using Photon Fusion 2

**IMPORTANT**: 🖱️ Currently, I could use WebGL only with Shared mode. If you start the game on the web, please click the "Shared" button.

🚀 **Tip**: WebGL builds work better on Chrome (there is probably some bug in Firefox).

# 📜 Gameplay Instructions

## 🚀 Starting the Game
- 👾 Players can join in shared mode.
- 🖱️ Choose the shared mode from the simple GUI at the start.

## 🛡️ Shield Power-Up
- Look for the shield appearing randomly in the battlefield.
- Move your player to collect the shield and become immune to bullets.
- The shield is removed after a set duration or if the player is hit by a shield-breaking mechanic (if implemented).

## 🏆 Scoring Points
- Aim and shoot at other players to earn points.
- The scoreboard updates in real-time, allowing players to track their progress.
- 📊 You can see other players' scores above their avatars as well as your own game data in the upper-left corner of the screen.

## 🎥 Camera and Controls
- 🕹️ Use the keyboard to move your player (e.g., arrow keys).
- 🎯 Point with the mouse to look in a certain direction and move to adjust player rotation in that direction.
- 🔄 To aim and shoot in the desired direction, it's not enough for the camera to be set (since looking around doesn't move the player until the arrow keys are pressed). You also need to move and set your player in the camera's direction.
- 📷 The camera will follow your player for optimal gameplay visibility.

## 🎨 Change Player Color
- 🎨 Press the **C** key to give your player a random color.

# 🌟 Original Enhancements
- **🎥 Camera Follow**: Ensures that the player's view remains focused on their character.
- **🖱️ Mouse Direction-Based Movement**: Adds fluidity to navigation and precision to gameplay.
- **🎯 Directional Shooting**: Bullets are fired in the exact direction the player is facing for enhanced accuracy.
